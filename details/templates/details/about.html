                    short answer - NO! but yes, we know some of you prefer to work with the feel of the pencil in your
                    hand and smell the fresh paint. there are no restrictions on how you can create the artwork for the
                    poster. all we need is a well-scanned digital version of it as per the guidelines mentioned. so YES,
                    you may paint, create a paper collage, or do a doodle. we don't mind as long as it is relevant to
                    the theme at hand and can be used as a poster.

                <p class="faq-ans paragraph-main pt-2">
                    a poster is primarily a mass communication medium. they are designed to both eye-catchy and
                    informative and convey a core idea through combining graphics and text. however, there have been
                    plenty of cases where the central idea has been conveyed with just text of graphics. our screening
                    of entries that qualify for shortlisting for voting will be primarily based on how well they
                    communicate the themes mentioned to the public.

                </h4>
                <p class="faq-ans paragraph-main pt-2">
                    NO. as a global public service campaign, we urge everyone to create the posters in english and not
                    in any other language. however, you may use non-english scripts for ornamental/graphic purposes as
                    part of your artwork, as long as the core communication for the poster is not dependent on it.

                <p class="faq-ans paragraph-main pt-2">
                    yes. there is no limit to the number of entries you can send. but make sure to post them as individual posts on instagram. also send them as individual emails.

                <p class="faq-ans paragraph-main pt-2">
                    the community voting happens through Instagram's likes. so it is essential that you publish entries on Instagram so that we can repost them for voting on our profile. ofcource, we can post it on your behalf, but that is prone to errors and we are a small team, and would really wish to avoid the overheads in tracking this. so we really request you to consider posting on Instagram as well as sending via email.

                <p class="faq-ans paragraph-main pt-2">
                    no. for us to track your entries properly, we request you to use the "Tag" feature of Instagram, and not just mentioning us on the comments or in post description.
